title: Setup
---

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::prereq

In this lesson we use Git from the Unix Shell. Some previous experience with the shell is expected, but isnâ€™t mandatory.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Computer

Participants must work on a computer with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) on which they have administrative privileges.

## Software Setup

To participate in this workshop, you will need to prepare the following (if you haven't already):

1. Install Shell and Git. Please refer to [this page](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/git-in-terminal/#installation) for installation instructions.
2. Create a GitHub account. Please refer to [this page](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/github/) for instructions.
3. Set up an SSH connection to GitHub. Please refer to [this page](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/ssh/) for instructions.

### To confirm that everything works

You should now be able to open a terminal window and execute the following commands:

#### Git

```bash
$ git --version
```
returning (something similar to):

```bash
git version 2.34.1
```

#### Github account & SSH connection

```bash
ssh git@github.com
```

which will return:

```bash
Hi [username]! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
Connection to github.com closed.
```

### If something does not work

Follow the corresponding setup instructions. If you still need help, send us an email at training@esciencecenter.nl.
